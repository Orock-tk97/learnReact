BABEL transpiler to convert jsx to js that can be undertood by browsers
jsx is an extesnion of js that allow us to write react code in a more simple way it is not html
we can only use integer strings in jsx and not booleans

a component is a function that returns a jsx template that is exported at the end of the file


only anonymous functions can be placed when using 
buttons such that the refrennce is passed and not he button itself
when we handle an event we automatically gain as reference the 1st object called e

components are stateless so for us to make dynamic content display we must rmploy theuse of us

when dynamically creating elements we must use ids for react to understand it in the dom
example when iterating through an object to print it out the content is dynamica and react must
be able to disntingusih it

// each top level porperty acts as a resource and each resource provides endpoints for the database to act with it ()
// use json server  package to watch the file an wrap it with some endpoints
// install json serve lcally or use npx to run code form the web adn it will still wtach our file


use-effect and usestate will always trigger the re-rendering of the virtual DOM
use state for changing state while useeefect for runnig code during a render


we use hook dependcies  to specify the array that we want to affect while re-rendering the
state of react

use effect is usually used to fetch data because for learning puposes we donot keep
data in objects but meta data we rather keep them in databases and use API's to fetch
 them when we call the use-effect function
